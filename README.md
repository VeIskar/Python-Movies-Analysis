# Movie Dataset Exploration and Correlation Analysis
This project is a comprehensive exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis of a movie dataset (found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies) using Python and jupyter lab. The primary objective is to uncover insights into various movie attributes, such as budget, gross earnings, runtime, and ratings, and how they correlate with each other. 

### Features
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset by dropping rows with null values and converting data types for numerical analysis.
2. Summary Statistics: Generated summary statistics and skewness values for key numerical features.
3. Correlation Analysis: Explored correlations between numerical features using scatter plots, regression plots, and heatmaps.
4. Visualizations: Created various plots to visualize the distribution of numerical data, trends over time, and the distribution of movies by genre, as well as analyses of top directors and actors.

#### Key Findings
- Identified strong correlations between movie budget and gross earnings.
- Visualized trends in movie budgets and gross earnings over the years.
- Analyzed the distribution of movies across different genres.
- Highlighted the most prolific directors and actors in the dataset.

### Setup and requirements
- Clone the repository
- Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)
- Open analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
